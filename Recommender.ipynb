    "It's a recommendation technique where we look at the **feature of the items** a user has liked, and recommend **similar items** based on those features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Think of it as: ***if you liked item A with feature X, you'll probably like item B, which also has feature X.***\n",

    "#### Example Scenario\n",
    "Say you've watched three Sci-Fi movies rated very highly. Your user profile becomes:  \n",
    "1. Genre: Sci-Fi heavy.  \n",
    "2. Preference for high IMDB ratings.\n",
    "3. Maybe specific directors or themes (if features allow).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when recommending a new movie, the system finds items with **similar features** like **Genre** and **IMDB Rating** and ranks them based on **similarity**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Similarity Metrics\n",
    "Similarity metrics are **mathematical tools** used to quantify how alike two objects are. In content-based filtering, they help measure the **closeness between a user's profile** and an **item's feature vector**,  \n",

    "| **Euclidean Distance** | Measures straight-line distance between two vectors (includes magnitude) | Easy to interpret, considers magnitude                | Can be skewed by large scale differences              | When magnitude matters (e.g., numerical ratings)   |\n"
