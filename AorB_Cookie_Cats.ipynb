    "## Main Objective\n",
    "The Main objective of this A/B testing is to examine what happens when the first gate in the game was moved from level 30 to level 40!  \n",
    "When a player installed the game, he or she was randomly assigned to either gate_30 or gate_40.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "The data we have is from 90,189 players that installed the game while the AB-test was running. The variables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **userid**: A unique number that identifies each player.\n",
    "2. **version**: Whether the player was put in the control group (gate_30 - a gate at level 30) or the group with the moved gate (gate_40 - a gate at level 40).\n",
    "3. **sum_gamerounds**: the number of game rounds played by the player during the first 14 days after install.\n",
    "4. **retention_1**: Did the player come back and play 1 day after installing?\n",
    "5. **retention_7**: Did the player come back and play 7 days after installing?  \n",
    "When a player installed the game, he or she was randomly assigned to either.  \n",
    "The dataset can be accessed at: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mursideyarkin/mobile-games-ab-testing-cookie-cats/data]  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses:\n",
    "**Null Hypothesis $H_0$:** Moving the first gate from level 30 to level 40 does not have any significant impact on player behavior.  \n",
    "In other words, there is no statistical difference in key metrics (sum_gamerounds, retention_1, and retention_7) between players assigned to gate_30 (control) and gate_40 (treatment).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative Hypothesis $H_1$:** Shifting the first gate from level 30 to level 40 does lead to a statistically significant impact on player behavior.  \n",
    "This means that at least one of the metrics (e.g., the number of game rounds played or retention rates) differs between the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Objective**: The primary objective is to evaluate the impact of changing the first gateâ€™s position on early player metrics, including engagement and retention."
