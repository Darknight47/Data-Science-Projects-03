    "# Main Objective\n",
    "> How to perform cost and profitability analysis of a business operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis** is a detailed review of how a food delivery service spends and earns money. Its purpose is to find ways to cut unnecessary costs, boost income, and adjust pricing or commission rates so the business can make more profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis** is a process of looking at all the expenses involved in delivering food — from direct costs like driver pay, fuel, and packaging to indirect costs like customer discounts and restaurant commissions — and comparing them with the money the service earns from order values, delivery fees, and commissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "> This helps the business see exactly how much profit it makes on each order, spot areas to cut costs, and find ways to adjust pricing or commissions to boost overall profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case Study:\n",
    "You are a data scientist at a food delivery company that is struggling to turn a profit. The company has provided you with a dataset containing details of 1,000 food orders, including order values, delivery fees, discounts, commissions, and other cost components. Your task is to analyze the cost structure and revenue streams to determine per-order profitability, identify patterns affecting overall margins, and recommend data-driven strategies to improve the company’s financial performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "1. **Order ID**: A unique code or number for each order.\n",
    "2. **Customer ID**: A unique identifier for each customer.\n",
    "3. **Restaurant ID**: A unique identifier for each restaurant.\n",
    "4. **Order Date and Time**: The exact date and time when the customer placed the order.\n",
    "5. **Delivery Date and Time**: The exact date and time when the order was delivered to the customer.\n",
    "6. **Order Value**: The total price of the food items ordered before adding delivery fees, taxes, or discounts.\n",
    "7. **Delivery Fee**: The amount charged to the customer for delivering the order (sometimes also includes a service charge).\n",
    "8. **Payment Method**: How the customer paid — e.g., credit card, debit card, cash on delivery, digital wallet.\n",
    "9. **Discounts and Offers**: The total value of price reductions applied to the order.\n",
    "10. **Commission Fee**: The percentage or fixed amount the delivery platform takes from the restaurant’s earnings for facilitating the order.\n",
    "11. **Payment Processing Fee**: The fee charged by payment processors.\n",
    "12. **Refunds/Chargebacks**: Money the company returns to the customer because of an issue (wrong order, late delivery, payment dispute, etc.)."
