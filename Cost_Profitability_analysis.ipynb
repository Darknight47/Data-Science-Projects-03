    "# Main Objective\n",
    "> How to perform cost and profitability analysis of a business operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis** is a detailed review of how a food delivery service spends and earns money. Its purpose is to find ways to cut unnecessary costs, boost income, and adjust pricing or commission rates so the business can make more profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis** is a process of looking at all the expenses involved in delivering food — from direct costs like driver pay, fuel, and packaging to indirect costs like customer discounts and restaurant commissions — and comparing them with the money the service earns from order values, delivery fees, and commissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "> This helps the business see exactly how much profit it makes on each order, spot areas to cut costs, and find ways to adjust pricing or commissions to boost overall profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case Study:\n",
    "You are a data scientist at a food delivery company that is struggling to turn a profit. The company has provided you with a dataset containing details of 1,000 food orders, including order values, delivery fees, discounts, commissions, and other cost components. Your task is to analyze the cost structure and revenue streams to determine per-order profitability, identify patterns affecting overall margins, and recommend data-driven strategies to improve the company’s financial performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "1. **Order ID**: A unique code or number for each order.\n",
    "2. **Customer ID**: A unique identifier for each customer.\n",
    "3. **Restaurant ID**: A unique identifier for each restaurant.\n",
    "4. **Order Date and Time**: The exact date and time when the customer placed the order.\n",
    "5. **Delivery Date and Time**: The exact date and time when the order was delivered to the customer.\n",
    "6. **Order Value**: The total price of the food items ordered before adding delivery fees, taxes, or discounts.\n",
    "7. **Delivery Fee**: The amount charged to the customer for delivering the order (sometimes also includes a service charge).\n",
    "8. **Payment Method**: How the customer paid — e.g., credit card, debit card, cash on delivery, digital wallet.\n",
    "9. **Discounts and Offers**: The total value of price reductions applied to the order.\n",
    "10. **Commission Fee**: The percentage or fixed amount the delivery platform takes from the restaurant’s earnings for facilitating the order.\n",
    "11. **Payment Processing Fee**: The fee charged by payment processors.\n",
    "12. **Refunds/Chargebacks**: Money the company returns to the customer because of an issue (wrong order, late delivery, payment dispute, etc.)."

    "### Cost Analysis\n",
    "**Revenue**  → All the money your business earns from sales before subtracting any costs.  \n",
    "Example: If an order costs $30 (food + delivery fee), your revenue is $30.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost** → All the money your business spends to provide the service. This includes both:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct costs** (costs tied directly to fulfilling an order — e.g., delivery driver fee, packaging, payment processor fee).  \n",
    "2. **Indirect costs** (overheads or less directly linked costs — e.g., marketing discounts, refunds).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Profit** → What’s left after subtracting all costs from revenue. Formula: $\\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Total Cost}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions for Analysis\n",
    "Since the dataset lacks explicit driver wages, packaging costs, and marketing expenses, we make the following assumptions to create a realistic financial model:  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Revenue Streams for the Platform\n",
    "1. **Commission Fee** – Main source of revenue from restaurants!  \n",
    "2. **Delivery Fee** (Customer-Paid) – It retained by the platform!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Costs to the Platform\n",
    "1. **Delivery Cost** - In absence of direct data, we assume **Delivery Cost = 80% of Delivery Fee**  \n",
    "2. **Payment Processing Fee** – Percentage charged by payment gateway (already in dataset).  \n",
    "3. **Discounts and Offers** – We assume it is funded entirely by the platform, counted fully as a cost! (**Discount Amount** calculated already!)  \n",
    "4. **Refunds/Chargebacks** – Full amount treated as a cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Delivery Fee Inspection\n",
    "We are performing **Delivery Fee** inspection because the Delivery Fee is part of the platform’s revenue, but 168 out of 1,000 orders have a fee of zero. Since we cannot confirm the reason with stakeholders, we first explore the data to identify any patterns (e.g., certain restaurants, dates, or promotions) that could explain these missing fees. Based on our findings, we will later make a documented assumption to handle these cases consistently in our profitability analysis."
