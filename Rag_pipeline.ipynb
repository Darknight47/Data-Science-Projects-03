    "## Main Goal\n",
    "The main objective of this project is to build a **RAG Pipeline** for LLMs using Hugging Face Transformers and Python!  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the RAG pipeline?\n",
    "The RAG pipeline combines the generative power of LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms. Instead of relying solely on the pre-trained knowledge of the model, which might become outdated or incomplete, RAG introduces a retrieval step. It works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieve relevant information**: Using a search or database query system, the pipeline fetches highly relevant and up-to-date context from external sources (e.g., documents, knowledge bases, or the internet).\n",
    "2. **Augment generation**: The retrieved information is then fed to the LLM to guide its response, ensuring answers are informed, specific, and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What does RAG solve?\n",
    "1. **Knowledge limitations**: LLMs might have a knowledge cutoff date or lack specific information. RAG enables dynamic retrieval, ensuring responses remain current and relevant.\n",
    "2. **Context specificity**: By incorporating targeted context, RAG improves the accuracy and relevance of the generated content.\n",
    "3. **Scalability**: It reduces dependency on the LLM storing massive datasets internally, as the retrieval system can query diverse sources.\n",
    "4. **Hallucinations**: LLMs sometimes produce \"hallucinated\" or fabricated information. RAG minimizes this risk by grounding responses in actual, retrieved context."
